  <h2>Russia's 'Dyatlov Pass' conspiracy theory may finally be solved 60 years later</h2>
  <p><b>By Brandon Specktor</b></p>
  <img class="img-article" src="../lesson05/images/pexels-mikhail-nilov-6526177.jpg">
  <p>In the infamous 'Dyatlov Pass incident,' nine young hikers died under mysterious circumstances. 
    Now, there's a scientific explanation.In January 1959, a group of nine young hikers — seven men and two 
    women — trudged through Russia's.<br><br>
    snowy Ural Mountains toward a peak locally known as "Dead Mountain." The hikers pitched their tents 
    at the base of a small slope, as an intensifying blizzard chilled the night air to minus 19 degrees 
    Fahrenheit (minus 25 degrees Celsius). They never made it to their next waypoint.<br><br>

    It took nearly a month for investigators to find all nine bodies scattered amid the snow, trees and 
    ravines of Dead Mountain. Some of the hikers died half-dressed, in just their socks and long underwear. 
    Some had broken bones and cracked skulls; some were missing their eyes; and one young woman had lost her 
    tongue, possibly to hungry wildlife. Their tent, half-buried in the snow and apparently slashed open from 
    the inside, still held some of the hikers' neatly-folded clothes and half-eaten provisions.<br><br>
    
    All nine hikers had died of hypothermia after being cast into the cold "under the influence of a compelling 
    natural force," a Russian investigation concluded at the time. But the specifics of the "compelling" force 
    behind the now-infamous "Dyatlov Pass incident" (named for one of the hikers, Igor Dyatlov) have long remained 
    a mystery, and given rise to one of the most enduring conspiracy theories... <a href="https://www.livescience.com/dyatlov-pass-incident-slab-avalanche-hypothesis.html">continue to full article</a>
